## Insurance Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a linear regression model to predict insurance charges based on various demographic and health-related features. The dataset includes information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

### Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Age: Age of the individual.
Sex: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
